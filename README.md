# This repo contains the code for the paper "Topo-GraT: Learning to Grow with Causal Graph Transformers," accepted at AAAI 2026.
## The paper introduces a new approach to cancer segmentation in medical images. Instead of treating it as a static pattern recognition problem, we reframe it as a causal process, modeling how a tumor grows rather than just what it looks like.
## Our model, Topo-GraT, uses a Causal Growth Field (CGF) to learn the dynamics of tumor invasion and a novel Causal Flow Attention (CFA) to embed this biological prior into the architecture. This method leads to more robust, state-of-the-art segmentation and yields the CGF as an interpretable biomarker for tumor aggressiveness.
